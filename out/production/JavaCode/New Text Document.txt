To add a file to a GitHub repository using Git Bash, follow these steps:

1. **Open Git Bash** and navigate to your repository's directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/repository
   ```

2. **Add the file(s)** to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add filename
   ```
   Replace `filename` with the name of the file you want to add. To add all changed files, you can use:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the changes** with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. **Push the changes** to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with the branch name you are working on if it is different.

Here is a summary of the commands:

```bash
cd path/to/your/repository
git add filename       # or 'git add .' to add all changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main   # replace 'main' with your branch name if necessary
```

If you have not set up your remote repository or if you need to change it, you can do so using:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with the name of your repository.
